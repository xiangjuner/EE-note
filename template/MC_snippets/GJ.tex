\paragraph{Short description:}

Prompt single-photon production was simulated with the
\SHERPA[2.2]~\cite{Bothmann:2019yzt} generator. In this set-up, NLO-accurate
matrix elements for up to two partons, and LO-accurate matrix elements for up
to four partons were calculated with the Comix~\cite{Gleisberg:2008fv} and
\OPENLOOPS~\cite{Buccioni:2019sur,Cascioli:2011va,Denner:2016kdg} libraries. They were matched
with the \SHERPA parton shower~\cite{Schumann:2007mg} using the \MEPSatNLO
prescription~\cite{Hoeche:2011fd,Hoeche:2012yf,Catani:2001cc,Hoeche:2009rj}
with a dynamic merging cut~\cite{Siegert:2016bre} of 20~\GeV.
Photons were required to be isolated according to
a smooth-cone isolation criterion~\cite{Frixione:1998jh}. Samples were generated using the
\NNPDF[3.0nnlo] PDF set~\cite{Ball:2014uwa}, along with the dedicated set of
tuned parton-shower parameters developed by the \SHERPA authors.

\paragraph{Long description:}

Prompt single-photon production was simulated with the
\SHERPA[2.2]~\cite{Bothmann:2019yzt} parton shower Monte Carlo
generator. In this set-up, NLO-accurate
matrix elements for up to two partons, and LO-accurate matrix elements for up
to four partons were calculated with the Comix~\cite{Gleisberg:2008fv} and
\OPENLOOPS~\cite{Buccioni:2019sur,Cascioli:2011va,Denner:2016kdg} libraries.
The default \SHERPA parton shower~\cite{Schumann:2007mg} based on
Catani--Seymour dipole factorisation and the cluster hadronisation model~\cite{Winter:2003tt}
were used. They employed the dedicated set of tuned parameters developed by the
\SHERPA authors for this generator version and the \NNPDF[3.0nnlo] PDF
set~\cite{Ball:2014uwa}.

The NLO matrix elements for a given jet multiplicity were matched to the parton
shower using a colour-exact variant of the MC@NLO
algorithm~\cite{Hoeche:2011fd}. Different jet multiplicities were then merged
into an inclusive sample using an improved CKKW matching
procedure~\cite{Catani:2001cc,Hoeche:2009rj} which was extended to NLO
accuracy using the \MEPSatNLO prescription~\cite{Hoeche:2012yf}.
The merging cut was set dynamically at a scale of 20~\GeV{}
according to the prescription in Ref.~\cite{Siegert:2016bre}.

The renormalisation and factorisation scales for the photon-plus-jet core
process were set to the transverse energy of the photon, $E_\text{T}^\gamma$.
The strong coupling constant was set to $\alphas (m_Z)= 0.118$ and the QED coupling
constant was evaluated in the Thomson limit. Photons from the matrix elements were required 
to be central, by being within the rapidity range $|y_{\gamma}|<2.7$, and isolated according to a 
smooth-cone isolation criterion~\cite{Frixione:1998jh} with $\delta_0=0.1$, $\epsilon_{\gamma}=0.1$ and $n=2$.

The effects of QCD scale uncertainties were evaluated~\cite{Bothmann:2016nao} using
seven-point variations of the factorisation and renormalisation scales in the matrix elements.
The scales were varied independently by factors of $0.5$ and $2$, avoiding variations in opposite directions.

PDF uncertainties for the nominal PDF set were
evaluated using the 100 variation replicas, as well as $\pm 0.001$ shifts
of \alphas. Additionally, the results were cross-checked using the central values of the 
\CT[14nnlo]~\cite{Dulat:2015mca} and \MMHT[nnlo]~\cite{Harland-Lang:2014zoa} 
PDF sets.

%\textcolor{red}{ Several Monte Carlo slices were generated to ensure good statistics over the whole phase space. In each of them, the photon was required to fall within a $E_{T}^{\gamma}$ range that depends on the slice avoiding any double-counting when the different slices are combined.}



\subsubsection[yy+jets]{ $\gamma\gamma$+jets}
%\label{sec:gammajets-sherpa-nlo-diphoton}

\paragraph{Short description:}

Prompt diphoton production was simulated with the
\SHERPA[2.2]~\cite{Bothmann:2019yzt} generator. In this set-up, NLO-accurate
matrix elements for up to one parton, and LO-accurate matrix elements for up
to three partons were calculated with the Comix~\cite{Gleisberg:2008fv} and
\OPENLOOPS~\cite{Buccioni:2019sur,Cascioli:2011va,Denner:2016kdg} libraries. They were matched
with the \SHERPA parton shower~\cite{Schumann:2007mg} using the \MEPSatNLO
prescription~\cite{Hoeche:2011fd,Hoeche:2012yf,Catani:2001cc,Hoeche:2009rj}
with a dynamic merging cut~\cite{Siegert:2016bre} of 10~\GeV.

\paragraph{Description:}

Prompt single-photon production was simulated using the \SHERPA[2.1]~\cite{Bothmann:2019yzt}
generator. The tree-level matrix elements, generated for up to three
additional partons, were merged with the initial- and final-state parton showers using the

parton-shower parameters developed by the \SHERPA authors for this generator version. A
modified version of the cluster model~\cite{Winter:2003tt} was used
for the description of the fragmentation into hadrons. Photons from the matrix elements were

\paragraph{Description:}

Prompt single-photon production was simulated using the \PYTHIA[8.186]~\cite{Sjostrand:2007gs} generator. 
Events were generated using tree-level matrix elements for photon-plus-jet final
states as well as LO QCD dijet events, with the inclusion of initial-
and final-state parton showers. The fragmentation component was
modelled by final-state QED radiation arising from calculations of all
$2\rightarrow 2$ QCD processes. The \NNPDF[2.3lo]~\cite{Ball:2012cx} PDF
set was used in the matrix element calculation, the parton shower, and
the simulation of the multi-parton interactions. The samples
include a simulation of the underlying event with parameters set
according to the A14 tune~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021}. The Lund
string model~\cite{Andersson:1983ia,Sjostrand:1984ic} was used for the
description of the fragmentation into hadrons.
