\section{Single-top \texorpdfstring{\(tW\)}{tW} associated production}
\label{subsec:tW}

This section describes the MC samples used for the modelling of single-top \(tW\) associated production.
\Cref{subsubsec:tW_PP8} describes the \POWPY[8] samples -- both for the diagram removal (DR) set-ups,
which are used for the nominal prediction as well as uncertainties due to additional radiation and PDFs,
and for the diagram subtraction (DS) set-ups, which are used for the uncertainty due to the treatment
of the overlap with \ttbar production.
\Cref{subsubsec:tW_PH7} describes the \POWHER[7] samples used for the uncertainty
due to parton showering and hadronisation modelling, and \cref{subsubsec:tW_aMCP8} describes the
\MGNLOPY[8] samples used for the uncertainty due to the choice of matching scheme.

The reference cross-section values are extracted from Ref.~\cite{LHCTopWGsgtopXsec}.

The associated production of top quarks with \(W\) bosons (\(tW\)) was
modelled by the
\POWHEGBOX[v2]~\cite{Re:2010bp,Nason:2004rx,Frixione:2007vw,Alioli:2010xd}
generator at NLO in QCD using the five-flavour scheme and the
\NNPDF[3.0nlo] set of PDFs~\cite{Ball:2014uwa}.
The diagram removal scheme~\cite{Frixione:2008yi} was used to
remove interference and overlap with \ttbar production.
The related uncertainty was estimated by comparison with an alternative sample
generated using the diagram subtraction scheme~\cite{Frixione:2008yi,ATL-PHYS-PUB-2016-020}.\footnote{Analyses which do not use this approach
should obviously not use this sentence in their description.}
The events were interfaced to \PYTHIA[8.230]~\cite{Sjostrand:2014zea} using the A14
tune~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021} and the \NNPDF[2.3lo] set of
PDFs~\cite{Ball:2012cx}.

Single-top \(tW\) associated production was modelled using the
\POWHEGBOX[v2]~\cite{Re:2010bp,Nason:2004rx,Frixione:2007vw,Alioli:2010xd}
generator, which provided matrix elements at next-to-leading
order~(NLO) in the strong coupling constant \alphas\ in the five-flavour
scheme with the \NNPDF[3.0nlo]~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} parton
distribution function~(PDF) set.  The functional form of the
renormalisation and factorisation scales was set to the default scale,
which is equal to the top-quark mass (\(\mtop = \qty{172.5}{\GeV}\)).
The diagram removal scheme~\cite{Frixione:2008yi} was employed to handle the interference
with \ttbar production~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2016-020}.  The events were
interfaced with \PYTHIA[8.230]~\cite{Sjostrand:2014zea} using the A14
tune~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021} and the \NNPDF[2.3lo] PDF set.  The
decays of bottom and charm hadrons were simulated using the
\EVTGEN[1.6.0] program~\cite{Lange:2001uf}.

The inclusive cross-section was corrected to the theory prediction
calculated at NLO in QCD with NNLL soft-gluon
corrections~\cite{Kidonakis:2010ux,Kidonakis:2013zqa}.  For proton--proton
collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\rts = \qty{13}{\TeV}\), this
cross-section corresponds to \(\sigma(tW)_{\text{NLO+NNLL}} = 71.7 \pm 3.8\,\unit{\pb}\),
using a top-quark mass of \(\mtop = \qty{172.5}{\GeV}\).  The uncertainty in
the cross-section due to the PDF was calculated using the \MSTW[nnlo] 90\%
CL~\cite{Martin:2009iq,Martin:2009bu} PDF set, and was added in
quadrature to the effect of the scale uncertainty.

\input{top_isrfsr_powpy_long}

The nominal \POWPY[8] sample was compared with an alternative
sample generated using the diagram subtraction
scheme~\cite{Frixione:2008yi,ATL-PHYS-PUB-2016-020} to estimate the
uncertainty arising from the interference with \ttbar production.

To evaluate the PDF uncertainties for the nominal PDF, the 100
variations for \NNPDF[3.0nlo] were taken into account.
In addition, the central value of this PDF was compared with the
central values of the \CT[14nnlo]~\cite{Dulat:2015mca} and
\MMHT[nnlo]~\cite{Harland-Lang:2014zoa} PDF sets.

and were added in quadrature to the effect of the scale uncertainty.

\input{top_isrfsr_powpy_long}

To evaluate the PDF uncertainties for the nominal PDF, the 100 variations for \NNPDF[3.0nlo] were taken into account.
In addition, the central value of this PDF was compared with the central values of the
\CT[14nnlo]~\cite{Dulat:2015mca} and \MMHT[nnlo]~\cite{Harland-Lang:2014zoa} PDF sets.

\Cref{tab:schan_PH7} gives the DSIDs of the \(s\)-channel \POWHER[7] samples.
Single-top and single-anti-top events were generated in distinct samples.

The impact of using a different parton shower and hadronisation model was evaluated by comparing the nominal sample
with another sample produced with the \POWHEGBOX[v2]~\cite{Alioli:2009je,Nason:2004rx,Frixione:2007vw,Alioli:2010xd}
generator at NLO in the strong coupling constant \alphas in the five-flavour scheme using the
\NNPDF[3.0nlo]~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} parton distribution function~(PDF).
Events in the latter sample were interfaced with \HERWIG[7.04]~\cite{Bahr:2008pv,Bellm:2015jjp}, using the H7UE set of
tuned parameters~\cite{Bellm:2015jjp} and the \MMHT[lo] PDF set \cite{Harland-Lang:2014zoa}.

\POWHEGBOX provided matrix elements at next-to-leading order~(NLO) in the strong coupling constant \alphas
in the five-flavour scheme with the \NNPDF[3.0nlo]~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} parton distribution function~(PDF).
The functional form of the renormalisation and factorisation scales was set to the default scale, which is equal to the top-quark mass.
The decays of bottom and charm hadrons were simulated using the \EVTGEN[1.6.0] program~\cite{Lange:2001uf}.

The functional form of the renormalisation and factorisation scales was set to the default scale, which is equal to the top-quark mass.
The parton-shower starting scale had the functional form \(\muQ = \HT/2\)~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2017-007},
where \HT is defined as the scalar sum of the \pT of all outgoing partons.
Top quarks were decayed at LO using \MADSPIN~\cite{Frixione:2007zp,Artoisenet:2012st} to preserve all spin correlations.
The events were interfaced with \PYTHIA[8.230]~\cite{Sjostrand:2014zea}, using the A14 set of tuned parameters~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021}
and the \NNPDF[2.3lo] PDF set.
