Uncertainties from missing higher orders were
evaluated~\cite{Bothmann:2016nao} using seven variations of the QCD
factorisation and renormalisation scales in the matrix elements by
factors of \(0.5\) and \(2\), avoiding variations in opposite directions.

Uncertainties in the nominal PDF set were evaluated using 100 replica
variations. Additionally, the results were cross-checked using the
central values of the \CT[14nnlo]~\cite{Dulat:2015mca} and
\MMHT[nnlo]~\cite{Harland-Lang:2014zoa} PDF sets. The effect of the uncertainty
in the strong coupling constant \(\alphas\) was assessed by variations of \(\pm 0.001\).
