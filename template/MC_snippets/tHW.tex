\section[\tHW]{\tHW}
\label{subsec:tHW}

This section describes the MC samples used for the modelling of \tHW\ production.
\Cref{subsubsec:tHW_aMCP8} describes the \MGNLOPY[8] samples.

\paragraph{Samples}

The descriptions below correspond to the samples in \cref{tab:tHW_aMCP8}.

\paragraph{Short description:}

The \tHW{} production is modelled using the \MGNLO[2.6.2]~\cite{Alwall:2014hca} generator at NLO with the \NNPDF[3.0nlo]~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} parton distribution function~(PDF). The overlap with the \ttH{} production is removed using the diagram removal scheme~\cite{Frixione:2008yi,Demartin:2016axk}. The events are interfaced with \PYTHIA[8.235]~\cite{Sjostrand:2014zea} using the A14 parameter set~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021} and the \NNPDF[2.3lo]~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} PDF set.
The decays of bottom and charm hadrons are simulated using the \EVTGEN[1.6.0] program~\cite{Lange:2001uf}.


\paragraph{Long description:}

The \tHW{} samples were simulated using the \MGNLO[2.6.2]~\cite{Alwall:2014hca}
generator at NLO with the \NNPDF[3.0nlo]~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} parton distribution function~(PDF). The events were interfaced with
\PYTHIA[8.235]~\cite{Sjostrand:2014zea}~ using the A14 tune~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021} and the \NNPDF[2.3lo]~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} PDF set.
The top quark was decayed at LO using \MADSPIN~\cite{Frixione:2007zp,Artoisenet:2012st} to preserve spin correlations,
whereas the Higgs boson was decayed by \PYTHIA in the parton shower. The samples
were generated in the five-flavour scheme.
The functional form of the renormalisation and factorisation scales was set to the
default scale \(0.5\times \sum_i \sqrt{m^2_i+p^2_{\text{T},i}}\), where the sum runs over
all the particles generated from the matrix element calculation.
The decays of bottom and charm hadrons were simulated using the \EVTGEN[1.6.0] program~\cite{Lange:2001uf}.
