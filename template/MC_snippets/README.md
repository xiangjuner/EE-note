# MC generator snippets

This package provides description snippets for all the main Standard Model bulk samples.
The idea is that these can be copy-pasted by analysers straight into their INT/CONF/PUB notes or papers.

Note that the citations used in the snippets will be automatically available via the `atlaslatex` package!

You may have to add the `process` or `hepprocess` option to the `atlasphysics` package for some generators.

A compiled version can be found [on CDS](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2678867/).

If you have any questions, get in touch with [PMG](mailto:atlas-phys-pmg-conveners@cern.ch).
