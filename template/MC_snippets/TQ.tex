\chapter{Top-quark processes}
%\label{sec:TQ}

This chapter describes the samples used for top-quark processes.
The \ttbar\ samples are described in \cref{subsec:ttbar}.
Single-top samples are described in \cref{subsec:tW} for \(tW\) associated production,
in \cref{subsec:tchan} for \(t\)-channel production,
and in \cref{subsec:schan} for \(s\)-channel production.
Finally, \ttHF\ samples are described in \cref{subsec:ttHF}.
