\chapter{\Pileup overlay}

\paragraph{Description:}

The effect of multiple interactions in the same and neighbouring bunch
crossings (\pileup) was modelled by overlaying the simulated hard-scattering event with
inelastic proton--proton (\(pp\)) events generated with \PYTHIA[8.186]~\cite{Sjostrand:2007gs}
using the \NNPDF[2.3lo] set of parton distribution functions (PDF)~\cite{Ball:2012cx} and the
A3 set of tuned parameters~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2016-017}.

\paragraph{Optional description:}

The Monte Carlo (MC) events were weighted to reproduce the
distribution of the average number of interactions per bunch crossing
(\(\left<\mu \right>\)) observed in the data. The \(\left<\mu \right>\)
value in data was rescaled by a factor of \(1.03\pm 0.04\) to improve
agreement between data and simulation in the visible inelastic
proton--proton (\(pp\)) cross-section~\cite{STDM-2015-05}.
