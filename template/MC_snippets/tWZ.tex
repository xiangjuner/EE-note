\section[\tWZ]{\tWZ}
\label{subsec:tWZ}

This section describes the MC samples used for the modelling of \tWZ\ production.
\Cref{subsubsec:tWZ_aMCP8} describes the \MGNLOPY[8] samples,

The descriptions below correspond to the samples in \cref{tab:tWZ_aMCP8}.

\paragraph{Short description:}

The production of \tWZ\ events was modelled using the \MGNLO[2.3.3]~\cite{Alwall:2014hca}
generator at NLO with the \NNPDF[3.0nlo]~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} parton distribution function~(PDF).
The events were interfaced with \PYTHIA[8.212]~\cite{Sjostrand:2014zea}~ using the A14 tune~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021} and the
\NNPDF[2.3lo]~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} PDF set.
The decays of bottom and charm hadrons were simulated using the \EVTGEN[1.2.0] program~\cite{Lange:2001uf}.


\paragraph{Long description:}

The production of \tWZ events was modelled using the \MGNLO[2.3.3]~\cite{Alwall:2014hca}
generator at NLO with the \NNPDF[3.0nlo]~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} parton distribution function~(PDF).
The events were interfaced with
\PYTHIA[8.212]~\cite{Sjostrand:2014zea} using the A14 tune~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021} and the \NNPDF[2.3lo]~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} PDF set.
The top quark and the \(Z\) boson were decayed at LO using \MADSPIN~\cite{Frixione:2007zp,Artoisenet:2012st} to preserve spin correlations.
While the top quark was allowed to decay inclusively, the \(Z\) boson decay was restricted to a pair of charged leptons.
The five-flavour scheme was used, where all the quark masses are set to zero, except the top quark.
The renormalisation and factorisation scales were set to the top-quark mass.
The diagram removal scheme described in Ref.~\cite{Frixione:2008yi} was employed to handle the interference
between \tWZ and \ttZ, and was applied to the \tWZ sample.
A sample with the alternative scheme described in Ref.~\cite{Demartin:2016axk} was produced to assess the associated systematic uncertainty.
The decays of bottom and charm hadrons were simulated using the \EVTGEN[1.2.0] program~\cite{Lange:2001uf}.
