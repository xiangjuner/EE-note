\subsection{Overlap removal}

The reconstruction of the same energy deposits as multiple objects is resolved using the standard overlap removal tools, \texttt{AssociationUtils}, documented \href{https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas/athena/blob/21.2/PhysicsAnalysis/AnalysisCommon/AssociationUtils/README.rst}{here}

The (Standard/Heavy-flavor/Boosted/Boosted+Heavy-flavor/lepton-favored) working point is used corresponding to:

\(\Delta R\) is calculated using rapidity by default.
