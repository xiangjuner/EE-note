\section{Introduction}

This is a very brief, almost ``abstract-like'' section.  Immediately following is the 
Executive Summary, which should include all of the components that are sometimes in an 
introduction but they are organized in a way that will facilitate review by conveners
since they are in a standard way


\section{Executive Summary}
\include{executive_summary}

\section{Object selection}
The supporting notes should now include the following standardized tables of properties: each analysis should simply fill them
in by writing / replacing the value with the appropriate number or by choosing the appropriate option.
The idea of these tables is to harmonize some sections of the supporting notes as to make review and analysis comparisons simpler.

If you use non-standard selections which do not fit in these tables, this should of course be noted and discussed in more detail in the text.
 
\include{egamma_selection}
\include{muon_selection}
\include{tau_selection}
\include{jet_selection}
\include{btagging_selection}
\include{tracks_selection}
\include{overlap_removal}


\section{Event selection}
The following items should also be filled in for the event selection.

\include{event_cleaning}

\section{Control Regions / Data and MC}
After outlining the object and event selection, noting possible outstanding points that still
need to be addressed to freeze the selection, you should demonstrate that you can analyze
the dataset that you intend to publish.  This should include CR/VR plots for
the main backgrounds with the full data (full run-2 analyses) or at least a representative
majority of the data (analyses during data-taking); for the more minor backgrounds this may
still be in progress but an outline of the planned method should be present.


\section{Systematic Uncertainties}

Many systematics may still be missing but the note should include a proposed plan
listing the combined performance systematics you will need to consider in this analysis 
(+ timescale on which they will be available if not already) and an outline of how the 
systematics on the backgrounds (i.e. background modelling systematics) are proposed to be determined.

If not statistics-limited, ideally the dominant systematics would be present but this is not
strictly necessary such that you can know if special attention will need to be taken by the
editorial board.

\section{Statistical Model/Results}

An overview of the final fit setup including the final discriminating variables(s),
the (SR/CR) regions to be included in the fit and the floating normalisation parameters.
Some rough first  expected limits/discovery sensitivity plots are useful if you have them but
not necessary. In this case the binning of the final variable(s) and the systematics
smoothing/pruning should be indicated.
