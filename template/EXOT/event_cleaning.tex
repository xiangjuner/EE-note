\subsection{Event cleaning}
Following the \href{https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/Atlas/DataPreparationCheckListForPhysicsAnalysis}{recommendations of the DataPrep group}, the following event-level requirements are made.

We use the official GRL\@:
 \begin{verbatim} FILL IN HERE \end{verbatim}
 
The following event-level vetos are made to reject bad / corrupt events:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item LAr noise burst and data corruption (\verb|xAOD::EventInfo::LAr|),
  \item Tile corrupted events (\verb|xAOD::EventInfo::Tile|),
  \item events affected by the SCT recovery procedure for single event upsets (\verb|xAOD::EventInfo::SCT|),
  \item incomplete events (\verb|xAOD::EventInfo::Core|).
 \end{itemize}
 
 Debug stream events [have/have not] been included.
 
 Checks [have/have not] been done to remove duplicate events.
 
Events are required to have a primary vertex with at least two associated tracks.
The primary vertex is selected as the one with the largest \(\Sigma \pT^2\),
where the sum is over all tracks with transverse momentum \(\pT > \qty{0.4}{\GeV}\) that are associated with the vertex.
